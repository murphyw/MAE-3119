    "# Experiment 3: The Op-Amp: Five Easy Pieces\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 3.1 Introduction and Purpose\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The purpose of this experiment is to introduce the most important analog building block known as the operational amplifier (op-amp). The op-amp's versatility is demonstrated through five simple circuit configurations which illustrate its capability of providing voltage gain, load isolation, frequency-dependent operation, and its application as an instrumentation amplifier providing rejection of interfering signals. The limitations on the op-amp's performance are also shown through some simple tests.\r\n",
