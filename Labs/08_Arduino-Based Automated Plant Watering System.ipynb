    "## 8.1 Introduction and Purpose\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This experiment introduces students to the integration of sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators in a practical application. The purpose is to design and implement an automated plant watering system using an Arduino microcontroller, a soil moisture sensor, and a water pump. Students will learn about sensor interfacing, analog-to-digital conversion, decision-making algorithms, and actuator control while creating a functional system.\r\n",
