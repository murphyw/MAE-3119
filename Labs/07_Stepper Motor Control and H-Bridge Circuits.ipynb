    "\r\n",
    "## 7.1 Introduction and Purpose\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This experiment introduces students to stepper motor control and H-Bridge circuits, two fundamental concepts in power electronics and motor control. The purpose is to demonstrate the application of metal-oxide-silicon field effect transistor (MOSFET) devices in driving a stepper motor and controlling DC motors using H-Bridge configurations. Students will explore the transfer function characteristics of MOSFETs, implement stepper motor drive circuits, and construct H-Bridge circuits for bidirectional motor control.\r\n",
